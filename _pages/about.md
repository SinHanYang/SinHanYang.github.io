I am an undergradute student in the [Computer Science and Information Engineering Department](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw). My research interests span machine learning, interpretability of neural network, and natural language processing.

I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Hsin-Hsi Chen](http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/advisor.php) on fake news detection, and [Prof Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://www.lilyweng.net) on interpretability of neural network.
