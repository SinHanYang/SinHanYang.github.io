I am an research assistant at [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project](https://aip.riken.jp), working with Dr. [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io). My research interests span deep learning, along with its robustness and generalization. Specifically, my research vision is to understand deep learning as well as improve its robustness and generalization, both from theoretical and empirical perspectives.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Physics from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw). During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Prof. [Hsin-Hsi Chen](http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/advisor.php) on explainable fake news detection. I also worked with Prof. [Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilywenglab.github.io/) on adversarial robustness and interpretable continual learning.
