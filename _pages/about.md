I am an undergradute student in the [Computer Science and Information Engineering Department](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw). I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Hsin-Hsi Chen](http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/advisor.php), Prof. [Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilywenglab.github.io/), and Prof. [Jason D. Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io/).

My research interests span machine learning, interpretability of the neural network, and natural language processing. I work on the interpretability and generalization of deep learning algorithms from theoretical and empirical aspects.
